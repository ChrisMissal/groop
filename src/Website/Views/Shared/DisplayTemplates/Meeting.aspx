                With the new version of ASP.NET, developers can easily leverage the 
                Model-View-Controller pattern in ASP.NET applications. Pulling logic 
                away from the UI and the views has been difficult for a long time. 
                The Model-View-Presenter pattern helps a little bit, but the fact 
                that the view has to delegate to the presenter makes the UI pattern 
                difficult to work with. This session is a detailed overview of the 
                ASP.NET MVC Framework. It is meant for developers already building 
                systems with ASP.NET 3.5 SP1.
